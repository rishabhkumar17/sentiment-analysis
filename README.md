# Sentiment Analysis

This is a web application that allows users to input a text and get a prediction of whether the text is positive, negative, or neutral. The app is built using Node.js as the backend, AI model - TensorFlow.js and React.js as the frontend.

Start the backend by running the following command: 
### `npm run dev`

Start the frontend by running the following command in a separate terminal window:
